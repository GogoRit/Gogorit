### Hi there 👋

I'm **Gaurank Maheshwari**, a Master's student in Data Science at RIT, passionate about **scalable AI systems, machine learning research, and applied data science**.  

- 🔭 **Currently focusing on:**  
  - High-Performance ML (**CUDA, MPI, distributed training**)  
  - Model deployment and optimization (**vLLM, Triton, FSDP, Deepspeed, AWS Trainium/Inferentia**)  
  - Generative AI reliability (**hallucination reduction, bias detection, evaluation frameworks**)  

- 🌱 **What I’m upskilling in:**  
  - Advanced ML infrastructure and large-scale training systems  
  - End-to-end AI pipelines (data → models → deployment → monitoring)  
  - AI productization and workflow automation (**LangChain, Streamlit, Docker, AWS**)  

- 👯 **Looking to collaborate on:**  
  - Open-source initiatives in **LLM benchmarking, model evaluation, and generative AI reliability**  
  - Research or engineering work that bridges **theory and scalable practice**  

- 💬 **Ask me about:**  
  - Building scalable and efficient ML/AI systems  
  - Translating research ideas into usable, production-grade AI tools
